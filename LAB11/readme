CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS

Mention the principle of non-preemptive CPU algorithms. 
List them.
Give programming example of each. Consider the processes arrive at different time points.  
Give proper input and output to demonstrate the working of the algorithms . Also show the avg waiting time and average turn-around time of the processes.
